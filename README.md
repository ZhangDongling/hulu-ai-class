Aim of the class  

---
- Accurate understanding of statistical concepts
- Basic understanding of statistical methodology
- Trade-off nature of statistical solution (compared to mathematics)
- Idea of definite conclusion from randomness  


Outline for opening & basics  

---  
- Probability theory  
- Distribution function family  
- Random samples  
- Statistics(统计量)  

Probabiliby mass and density function   

---  
- If Ω is discrete (finite or countable infinite)  
  - P can be fully characterized by P(w1), P(w2), ... which is called probability mass function  
- If Ω is continuous (like diameter of a tube)  
  - P can be characterized by density function p(w), P(Ω) = ∫<sub>Ω</sub>p(w)dw = 1, which is called probability density function
